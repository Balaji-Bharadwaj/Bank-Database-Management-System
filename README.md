# Introduction: 

Banks are large financial institutions that gather and process large amounts of data on a daily basis. Storing information such as customer details, employee details, transactions, loans, and account statements is of paramount importance. Apart from maintaining the details, a bank must also provide timely and accurate information about customer accounts, balances, and transactions to its customers. A bank must also mitigate risks associated with bad loans and other financial activities. 
Finally, being financial institutions, banks are subjected to a range of regulatory requirements related to data privacy, security, and financial reporting.

A banking system database can efficiently store and manage up-to-date records, reduce errors, and improve the overall efficiency of their operations. It will also enable the banks to offer better customer service.
Lastly, a database would help the bank comply with financial regulations by maintaining accurate and up-to-date records and providing the necessary information for audits and regulatory reporting.

The target users for this database are bank representatives, bank tellers, bank product sales representatives, and bank managers.
