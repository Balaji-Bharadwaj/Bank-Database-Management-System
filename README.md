Banks are large financial institutions that gather and process large amounts of data on a daily basis. Storing information such as customer details, employee details, transactions, loans, and account statements is of paramount importance. Apart from maintaining the details, a bank must also provide timely and accurate information about customer accounts, balances, and transactions to its customers. A bank must also mitigate risks associated with bad loans and other financial activities. 
Finally, being financial institutions, banks are subjected to a range of regulatory requirements related to data privacy, security, and financial reporting.
